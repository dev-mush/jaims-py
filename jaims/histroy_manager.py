        Developer Notes
        ---------------

        # Optimization Feature
        This is roughly how the optimization feature works right now, plus some notes on how I intend to improve it.
        The tokens for the messages to send to openai are calculated by composing the mandatory_context, the chat history managed by this class
        and the functions in a variable named compound_history.
        They are parsed to a json string and tiktoken evaluates the token consumption based on the current llm model setting.

        Right now I'm parsing the whole compound_history, including the functions, to json and calculating the tokens based on the json string,
        but I'm not sure how accurate this is.
        On rough estimates made with the tokenizer from openai they seem to be pretty accurate, but I need to investigate more.

        A high level overview of the optimization loop is the following:

        the max_tokens to be used are the max tokens supported by the current llm model, minus the tokens to leave out for the response
        from openai passed in agent_max_tokens (passed with a default value) .

        The compound_history tokens are calculated, and while they exceed the context max_tokens:
        1. the first (oldest) message from the chat history between the user and the angent is popped
        2. the compound_history tokens are recalculated
        3. if the compound_history tokens are still above the context max_tokens, the process is repeated from step 1
            3.1. if the chat history between user and agent remains empty for some reason
                (this could happen for instance if functions and mandatory context are way too big),
                an exception is raised. I think it aids development but have to think about it.
        4. if the compound_history tokens are below the context max_tokens, the mandatory_context + the optimized history are returned.

        TODO:
        - optimize functions messages in the history

        MAYBE TODO:
        - it would be nice to have an auto-scale up of the context, for instance passing from the gpt-3.5-turbo 4k to the 16k model.
